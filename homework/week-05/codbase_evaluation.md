# Open Source Contribution Plan

For my first open-source contribution, I plan to start by working on beginner-level issues in documentation and smaller fixes, but I am still exploring projects that align well with my skillset. I want to contribute to projects where I can utilize my experience in Python and tools that I frequently use.

## Project Considerations

### PyCaret Library
One example is the [**PyCaret**](https://github.com/pycaret/pycaret/issues) library, which simplifies machine learning workflows with minimal code. I have relevant experience in machine learning and data science, making this project a good fit. I am comfortable with libraries like **scikit-learn** and **pandas**, which will be useful to contribute to pycaret.

### Amazon Q for Command Line
Additionally, I am exploring the [**Amazon Q for command line**](https://github.com/aws/q-command-line-discussions) (previously [Fig](https://github.com/withfig/autocomplete)) project. I use this autocompletion tool regularly and contributing to it would align with my technical knowledge in command-line tools and my interest in cloud services. I am looking for entry-level issues related to Python scripting or shell commands that I can help resolve.

## Resources for Finding Projects

I am currently looking at several websites to find interesting projects, including:
- [Good First Issues](https://goodfirstissues.com/)
- [Awesome for Beginners GitHub Repo](https://github.com/MunGell/awesome-for-beginners)

These resources have been helpful in identifying projects that match my skillset and where I can make meaningful contributions. I will continue looking for a project and update this evaluation when I find the codbase I want to work on for my first open source contribution.
