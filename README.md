# Mehedi Hasan Sizar ([@mhsizar](https://github.com/mhsizar))  

Hi, I am Sizar, a rising senior (graduating December, 2025) at Bennington College concentrating in Computer Science and Mathematics. My primary areas of interest lie in data science, machine learning, and software development. I took this class to gain hands-on experience contributing to open-source projects (especially related to AI/ML), improve my programming skills, and learn how collaborative development can solve real-world problems. Check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/mhsizar) and let's get connected on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mhsizar/)!
