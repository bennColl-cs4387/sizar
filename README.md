This is Sizar's repository for the CS4387 class

As part of the first assignment, I have added the syllabus and class grid to this repository:  
&rarr; [Class Syllabus: Open Source Software in Practice (CS4387)](https://github.com/bennColl-cs4387/sizar/blob/main/Syllabus/class_syllabus.md)  
&rarr; [Weekly Grid: Open Source Software in Practice (CS4387)](https://github.com/bennColl-cs4387/sizar/blob/main/Syllabus/class_schedule.md)  
  
As part of the second assignment, I have added the history of my terminal commands to solve the [git murder mystery](https://github.com/nivbend/gitstery):  
&rarr; [How I Solved the Git Murder Mystery](https://github.com/bennColl-cs4387/sizar/blob/main/gmm/gmm_history_sizar.txt) 

As part of the third assignment, I have added the [codebase evaluation](https://github.com/bennColl-cs4387/sizar/blob/main/first-issue/codbase-evaluation.md) for my first fix. 

For the fourth assignment, I have documented how I [built PyCaret from source](https://github.com/bennColl-cs4387/sizar/blob/main/first-issue/build_from_source.md) on my local machine.

I have written an essay on my pick for the first fix and solution proposal here:

I have been working with Arpon and Sinha to fix the [PyCaret Issue #3011](https://github.com/pycaret/pycaret/issues/3011). We have documented our progress on the group work [here](https://github.com/bennColl-cs4387/sizar/blob/main/group-fix/group_fix.md).
