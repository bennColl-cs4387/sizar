# Mehedi Hasan Sizar ([@mhsizar](https://github.com/mhsizar))  

Hi, I am Sizar, a rising senior (graduating December, 2025) at Bennington College concentrating in Computer Science and Mathematics. My primary areas of interest lie in data science, machine learning, and software development. I took this class to gain hands-on experience contributing to open-source projects (especially related to AI/ML), improve my programming skills, and learn how collaborative development can solve real-world problems. Check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/mhsizar) and let's get connected on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mhsizar/)!

## Solo Fixes

### 1. [Making Plotting Dependencies Optional](https://github.com/pycaret/pycaret/issues/4066)  
Moved plotting-related dependencies in PyCaret to an optional section, making installation smaller and faster. This included editing `requirements.txt`, updating `setup.py`, and handling missing dependencies gracefully.  
Pull Request: [#4102](https://github.com/pycaret/pycaret/pull/4102)  
Documentation: [Solution to PyCaret Issue #4066](https://github.com/bennColl-cs4387/sizar/blob/main/assignments/solo-fixes/pycaret-4066/pycaret_4066.md)  

### 2. [Fixing Fold Number Calculation and Fold Validation in Time Series](https://github.com/pycaret/pycaret/issues/3011)  
Added a validation mechanism to PyCaret's `setup` function to ensure the `fold` parameter accepts only integers. Provided meaningful error messages to guide users when CV objects were passed incorrectly.
